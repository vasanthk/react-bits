# Wrapper Components
Using Wrappers to handle UX/style variations

For Handling Wrapper ``<div>``â€™s and other markup around component, use composition!

When you create a React component instance, you can include additional React components or JavaScript expressions between the opening and closing tags.
Parent can read its children by accessing the special this.props.children prop.

```javascript
const SampleComponent = () => {
  <Parent>
    <Child />
  </Parent>
};

const Parent = () => {
  // You can use class 'bla' or any other classes to handle any style variations for the same markup.
  <div className="bla">
    {this.props.children}
  </div>
};
```

FYI - Wrapper component can also be made accept a tag name and then used to generate the HTML element.
However, usually this is not recommended because you can't add attributes/props to it.

```javascript
const SampleComponent = () => {
  <Wrap tagName="div" content="Hello World" />
};

const Wrap = ({ tagName, content }) => {
  const Tag = `${tagName}`     // variable name must begin with capital letters
  return <Tag>{content}</Tag>
}
```
