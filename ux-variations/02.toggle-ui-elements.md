# Toggle UI Elements
Handling minor UX variations in the component by toggling ON/OFF features.

Modify the component to take in a prop to control it’s behavior.

### Gotcha:
Easy to overuse this idea by adding props for  every variation.
  Only add in props for features specific to the current feature that the component.
  Basically, not violate the Single Responsibility Principle.

### Example
Show/Hide password feature in Login form

```javascript
class PasswordField extends Component {
  render() {
    const {
      password,
      showHidePassword,
      showErrorOnTop,
      showLabels,
      shouldComplyAda
    } = this.props;
    return (
      <div>
        <Password
          field={password}
          label="Password"
          showErrorOnTop={showErrorOnTop}
          placeholder={shouldComplyAda ? "" : "Password"}
          showLabel={showLabels}
          showHidePassword={showHidePassword}
        />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
