# Spreading props on DOM elements
When we spread props we run into the risk of adding unknown HTML attributes, which is a bad practice.

#### Bad
This will try to add the unknown HTML attribute `flag` to the DOM element.
```javascript
const Sample = () => (<Spread flag={true} className="content"/>);
const Spread = (props) => (<div {...props}>Test</div>);
```
#### Good
By creating props specifically for DOM attribute, we can safely spread.
```javascript
const Sample = () => (<Spread flag={true} domProps={{className: "content"}}/>);
const Spread = (props) => (<div {...props.domProps}>Test</div>);
```

*Note*

In [scenarios](https://github.com/vasanthk/react-bits/issues/34) where you use a [PureComponent](../perf-tips/02.pure-component.md), when an update happens it re-renders the component even if `domProps` did not changed. This is because PureComponent only [shallowly compares](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-api.html#react.purecomponent) the objects.
