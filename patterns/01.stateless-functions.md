# Stateless Functions

Stateless functions are a great way to define highly reusable components.<br/>
They don't hold state; they're just functions.

One of the advantages of using functions includes a very clear separation of view and logic (see the first point), because there is no room for any logic.
The absence of the *this* keyword and thus lacking the ability to add functions that do internal state handling and logic further enforces this separation.

Stateless functional components will soon offer improved performance as well.<br/>
Since thereâ€™s no state or lifecycle methods to worry about, the React team plans to avoid unnecessary checks and memory allocations in future releases.

```javascript
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

const Greeting = () => <div>Hi there!</div>;

// They get passed props and context
const Greeting = (props, context) =>
  <div style={{color: context.color}}>Hi {props.name}</div>;

// They can define a local variable, when a function block is used.
const Greeting = (props, context) => {
  const style = {
    fontWeight: "bold",
    color: context.color
  };

  return <div style={style}>{props.name}</div>
};

// But you could get the same result by using other functions.
const getStyle = context => ({
  fontWeight: "bold",
  color: context.color
});

const Greeting = (props, context) =>
  <div style={getStyle(context)}>{props.name}</div>;

// They can have defined defaultProps, propTypes and contextTypes.
Greeting.propTypes = {
  name: PropTypes.string.isRequired
};
Greeting.defaultProps = {
  name: "Guest"
};
Greeting.contextTypes = {
  color: PropTypes.string
};
```
