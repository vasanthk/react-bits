# Function As Children
Using a function as children isnâ€™t inherently useful.

```javascript
<div>
  { () => "hello world!" }
</div>
```
However, it can be used in component authoring for some serious power. This technique is commonly referred to as render callbacks.

This is a powerful technique used by libraries like ReactMotion. When applied, rendering logic can be kept in the owner component, instead of being delegated.
