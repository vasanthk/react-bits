# JSX Spread Attributes

Spread Attributes is a JSX feature. It’s syntactic sugar for passing all of an object’s properties as JSX attributes.
The ... operator (or spread operator) is already supported for arrays in ES6. There is also a proposal to get the spread operator for object properties in ES2017.

```javascript
// Spread Attributes is a JSX feature. It’s syntactic sugar for passing all of
// an object’s properties as JSX attributes.

// These two examples are equivalent.

// props written as attributes
let main = () => <main className="main" role="main">{children}</main>;

// props "spread" from object
// Note: `children` key is used to populate the component children.
let main = () => <main {...{className: "main", role: "main", children}} />;

// Use this to forward props to underlying components.
let FancyDiv = (props) => <div className="fancy" {...props} />;

// Now, I can expect FancyDiv to add the attributes it's concerned with as well
// as those it's not.
let FancyDiv = () => <FancyDiv data-id="my-fancy-div">So Fancy</FancyDiv>;
// output: <div className="fancy" data-id="my-fancy-div">So Fancy</div>

// Keep in mind that order matters. If props.className is defined, it'll clobber
// the className defined by FancyDiv
let FancyDiv = () => <FancyDiv className="my-fancy-div"/>;
// output: <div className="my-fancy-div"></div>

// We can make FancyDivs className always “win” by placing it after
// the spread props ({...props}).

// my `className` clobbers your `className`
const FancyDiv = props =>
  <div {...props} className="fancy"/>;
// You should handle these types of props gracefully. In this case, I’ll merge
// the author’s props.className with the className needed to style my component.

const FancyDiv = ({ className, ...props }) => (
  <div
    className={["fancy", className].join(' ')}
    {...props}
  />
);
```
