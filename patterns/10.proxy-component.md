# Proxy Component

Buttons are everywhere in web apps. And every one of them must have the type attribute set to “button”.

```javascript
<button type="button">
```
Writing this attribute hundreds of times is error prone.

We can write a higher level component to proxy props to a lower-level button component.

```javascript
const Button = props => <button type="button" {...props}>
```

We can use Button in place of button and ensure that the type attribute is consistently applied everywhere.
```javascript
<Button />
// <button type="button"><button>

<Button className="CTA">Send Money</Button>
// <button type="button" class="CTA">Send Money</button>
```
