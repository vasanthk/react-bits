# Decorators
Decorators (*supported by Babel, in Stage 2 proposal as of 03/17*)

If you’re using something like mobx, you can decorate your class components — which is the same as passing the component into a function.
Decorators are flexible and readable way of modifying component functionality.

Non-decorators approach
```javascript
class ProfileContainer extends Component {
  // Component code
}
export default observer(ProfileContainer)
```
With decorators
```javascript
@observer
export default class ProfileContainer extends Component {
  // Component code
}
```
